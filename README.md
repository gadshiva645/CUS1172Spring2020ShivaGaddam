*Static REST API point to JSONPlaceholder service. I didn’t use a static REST API instead I have a questions object in my script file
*I didn’t load data from the fake API asynchronous using network request
*I have 20 different questions like multiple choice text, narrative questions with text response, true and false questions. The questions are about Java and javascript and react. 
*The application is a SPA
*I styled the application using CSS
*I have made only 1 quiz
*You have the option to retake the quiz when you are done

The technology that I’m using for deployment is Netlify. It easily enables you to deploy your static application. The deployment was simple as the first step is to have all your code inside of a github repository. Then you go to Netlify and you sign up with github. Then you create a new site from git and you choose github as continuous deployment. You then choose the repository that you want to use for the website. Finally you will have to deploy the site. Everytime you update your application all you need to do is update the github repository and the netlify website will reflect what is inside the repository on github.
