*Static REST API point to JSONPlaceholder service. I didn’t use a static REST API instead I have a questions object in my script file
*I didn’t load data from the fake API asynchronous using network request
*I have 20 different questions like multiple choice text, narrative questions with text response, true and false questions. The questions are about Java and javascript and react. 
*The application is a SPA
*I styled the application using CSS
*I have made only 1 quiz
*You have the option to retake the quiz when you are done
